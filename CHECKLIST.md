## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Python not found
**Solution:**
```bash
python --version
# Install from python.org if needed
```

### Issue: spaCy model error
**Solution:**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Issue: Module not found
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Permission denied on temp/
**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir temp
# Or run as administrator
```

### Issue: API returns 500 error
**Check:**
1. Python is installed
2. spaCy model is downloaded
3. temp/ directory exists
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Check terminal for Python errors
